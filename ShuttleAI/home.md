Shuttle AI is the best AI service out there, constantly updated and maintained with the fastest API speeds, dozens of models you can use, and other tools not just for chat-related tasks.

Shuttle is one of the most engaging communities out there, with quick support and even faster API response times. They have truly given me the motivation to start new projects and improve on past work.

ShuttleAI is like OpenAI API, accessing the latest and most powerful models, but for FREE, with 10x more model choices, for chat completion, image generation, text to speech and way more!

## @.oblivioz

I really LOVE ShuttleAI. I think it's a lot better than normal ChatGPT, but that's not all, the best of all it's so cheap, and budget friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
